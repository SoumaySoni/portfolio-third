            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                I am a self-driven and detail-oriented web developer with a strong focus on building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My journey into web development began with a genuine curiosity about how websites work, which quickly turned into a passion for creating clean and efficient digital experiences.
                <br />
                <br />
                I specialize in front-end technologies like React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, and I enjoy translating design concepts into functional interfaces that perform well across all devices. I value writing clean, maintainable code and continuously explore new technologies to improve my skills and stay current with industry standards.
                <br />
                <br />
                Though I don't come from a formal computer science background, I have built my knowledge through consistent learning, hands-on projects, and real-world application. This path has made me highly adaptable, resourceful, and proactive in solving technical challenges.
                <br />
                <br />
                I take pride in my ability to learn independently, collaborate effectively, and deliver high-quality results. My goal is to grow as a developer by working on meaningful projects that improve user experiences and push my technical boundaries.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whether working solo or as part of a team, I approach every opportunity with enthusiasm, professionalism, and a strong commitment to continuous improvement.
